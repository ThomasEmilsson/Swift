#Snap Jump

Attended the Copenhacks event and worked on Snap Jump. A game where the user takes pictures, draws platforms on those pictures, and ends up
creating small side scrolling games where the player plays as an emoji.

I had no experience in iOS development prior to this event. I spent my time learning how to work with UIKit and MapKit and in the end I
created the Main Menu Screen for the Game shown below.

Additionally, one team member made a short video about the game and the event which you can check out here: https://vimeo.com/163685747
